# Ways a Record Can Change #

When the following things occur:

 - A record is modified
 - A species splits into two or more species
 - Two or more species are combined into a single species
 - A species changes its name
 - ALA adds/removes an assertion from a record (i.e. jackknife outlier)

This will happen to each record:

 - uuid stays the same
 - some of the record fields change (including the species that the record
   applies to, and the list of assertions)
 - last_processed_date is updated

Although rare, records can be deleted from ALA. One way this can happen
is if a whole data set is reloaded from the source. In most reloads, the
record uuids will stay the same.  In a few reloads, the old records are
deleted and reloaded records will all have new uuids. There is no easy
way to query for records that have been deleted, so you may have to
query ALA with the record uuid to see if it still exists.

When a user reports an issue on (a.k.a. vets/adds assertion to) a record, or
deletes an issue from a record, the 'last_assertion_date' field is
updated.


## Scientific Name Homonyms ##

Some species scientific names (i.e. binomial names) can be homonyms. The
scientific name only contains the genus, subgenus, and species names. Two
different taxa can have the exact same genus, subgenus, and species names, but
have a different kingdom/phylum/class/order/family. For example there could be
two species named "Whateverus somethingia", where one is an animal (kingdom
ANIMALIA) and the other is a plant (kingdom Plantae).
